		<h2>Preface</h2>
		<h4>What is this guide?</h4>
		<p>This guide is a resource for families and caregivers of persons with autism spectrum disorder and anyone interested in learning about Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).</p>
		<h4>Why am I writing this?</h4>
		<p>I want more people to be informed about the therapeutic interventions that are recommended to autistic children because I lacked information when my own child received their diagnosis.</p>
		<h4>Who am I?</h4>
		<p>I&rsquo;m a non-traditional full time college student that is married with two children that are both on the autism spectrum. My children were 2 &frac12; and 3 when they were diagnosed, they are &nbsp;7 and 8 at the time of the publishing of this project guide. I have a very low income family with limited resources and time.</p>
  </content>
  <content>
		<h4>How to use this guide.</h4>
		<p>The resource binder can be read from front to back, or can be taken section to section on whatever theme interests you. Use the guide to help make a more informed decision about applied behavior analysis.</p>
		<h4>Why I hope this is useful.</h4>
		<p>I hope this is useful to start to inform families and caretakers about what to possibly expect when beginning ABA, its implementation, outcomes, alternatives, and the perspectives of a child that had to receive it and a parent that had to navigate and arrange it. </p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My child was different and I knew it in my heart. It was a feeling of confirmation when a certain pediatric developmental psychologist told me that my older child was on the autism spectrum. I had known that something was the matter soon into their toddlerhood. Milestones were beginning to be missed and regression was what developed alongside it. I had taken child development courses and suspected from my educational and lived experiences that something was not typical about my child. After receiving the diagnosis I wanted to know everything about autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and what autistic people had to say about their experiences.</p>
		<p>Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a therapeutic intervention that is utilized to change behavior. ABA is a therapeutic intervention that is used to decrease unwanted behaviors and increase desirable behaviors. Applied behavior analysis is prescribed for every child that is diagnosed with ASD. I wanted to know why that was. During the weeks after my child&rsquo;s diagnosis I set out on my own to research exactly that. &nbsp;I found very few academic articles that centered on the autistic person&rsquo;s experience of applied behavior analysis, and that disappointed and inspired me.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;Within the scope of this paper, ABA will focus on children with developmental disabilities, although it can be used in many other contexts. </p>
		<p>This paper is a guide to understanding Applied Behavior Analysis and it contains a &nbsp;qualitative study on the autistic experience with ABA. It is an opportunity to bring more to the collective knowledge about what happens to autistic children. Interviews with autistic adults that experienced ABA as children were held, recorded, and analyzed for themes and patterns. Within this guide resources on agencies and programs are compiled and listed to be helpful to guardians and caregivers. There will be some jargon used further along in the paper, but everything is explained. Along with the interview data is a literature review on the history of ABA, its implementation, outcomes, and alternatives. Applied behavior analysis interventions are successful for some individuals and not for others. Autistic voices being uplifted, and families being knowledgeable and empowered is what my focus is for this academic exercise.</p>

		<h2>History of Autism and ABA</h2>
		<h3>Brief History of Disability</h3>
		<center><p>Content warning: The following information can be disturbing. </p></center>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earliest views of disability were incredibly ignorant. People with disabilities were seen as punishments or curses from God or from the devil. They were marginalized, seen as unfit to live in society, and often isolated and kept hidden from the public. Many were forced to live in institutions and hospitals their entire lives, with many being sterilized. In the 1800&rsquo;s - 1900&rsquo;s many disabled people were making a living by begging on the street as they were denied access to education, care, and employment (ADL, 2018). </p>
	</content>
	<content>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1970&rsquo;s the Disability Rights Movement began. At this point a medical model of disability is what is recognized and how disabilities need to be &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;. The movement addressed physical barriers to access and it led to the social model of disability. The social model of disability views disability as a result of barriers within society, like inaccessible environments and negative attitudes, rather than solely from a person&#39;s physical or mental impairment; it emphasizes that society disables people by not accommodating their needs, not the impairment itself (Sense, 2024). </p>
		<p>Legislation helped to solidify the rights of disabled individuals. The Smith-Fess Act of 1920 made a federal program to help disabled people find employment. The Social Security Act of 1935 established a program to provide permanent assistance to adults with disabilities(Temple, 2019). In 1990, after much protesting, President Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act, giving civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities. Since then there has been an increase in understanding and acceptance of disabled persons. Disability Pride parades have been seen across the United States since 2007. The fight for accessibility and care still continues as activists are trying to save the Affordable Care Act. The history of disability is still very much being written. </p>

		<h3>Psychology, Psychologists, and Behavioral Sciences</h3>
		<p>Human behavior has been studied throughout history but for the purposes of this paper I will focus on the scholars that have developed the science that is foundational to applied behavior analysis. After the turn of the twentieth century, American psychologist John B. Watson was instrumental in developing the field of behavior analysis and psychology (Cividini-Motta et al., 2023). Watson&rsquo;s focus on observable, or overt, behavior through stimulus and response in the environment was the bedrock of behaviorism.  He outlined a framework for methodological behaviorism, a brand of behaviorism that negates consciousness, emotions, and mental states (Cividini-Motta et al., 2023). As opposed to methodological behaviorism, radical behaviorism holds that private or covert behavior is akin to overt behavior, given that both are influenced by changes in the environment albeit occurring at different levels of manifestation; &nbsp; B. F. Skinner is credited with introducing the philosophy of radical behaviorism and is esteemed as the preeminent psychologist of the twentieth century (Cividini-Motta et al., 2023). Consequently, radical behaviorism is considered an improvement upon Watson&rsquo;s behaviorism, as it also conceived of the science of behavior as a natural science, suggesting that all behavioral incidents, whether private or public, are natural phenomena that can be comprehended in relation to other natural events, including environmental stimuli that precede or follow the behavior (Cividini-Motta et al., 2023).</p>

		<p>Applied behavioral analysis is a type of many treatments for the neurodevelopmental condition designated autism. There is some dispute within the scientific community as to who first &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; autism. Some scholars think that it is important to know exactly who should receive credit for &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; autism, and there are many potential individuals that could lay claim. Ukrainian-American child psychologist Leo Kanner, Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, and Austrian psychiatrist Georg Frankl are the three professionals that are most attributed to the &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; of autism. There is not a clear cut answer to who &lsquo;discovered&rsquo; autism as many researchers were working and publishing findings simultaneously about an unknown condition.</p>
  </content>
  <content>
		<p>The diagnostic criteria for autism has changed over the course of decades and the changes have been seen in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the DSM. The shifts came in phases: 1) extreme autistic aloneness&nbsp;and an insistence on sameness (1943-1965; Leo Kanner), 2) language and other perceptual and cognitive abnormalities (1960-1980), 3) deficits in social cognition and instinct (1980-present). What physicians and psychologists were looking for in terms of traits and characteristics to be able to give care to patients was changing focus with greater amounts of research and cross-cultural exchange. This highlights the change in professional standards when diagnosing autism, and the societal shift in how disability was viewed. </p>
	</content>
	<content>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychologist, Dr. O. Ivar Lovaas, is recognized as pioneering applied behavior analytic interventions in the 1960&rsquo;s to autistic children to decrease severe challenging behaviors and establish communicative language, emphasizing early intervention and parental participation in therapeutic interventions. Lovaas essentially made the first blueprint on how to treat autistic individuals with severe deficits in communication in a comprehensive approach; many other researchers are credited with the individual components that constitute ABA prior to Lovaas (Smith &amp; Eikeseth, 2010). The structure of Lovaas&rsquo; contribution formalized the framework in manipulating undesired behaviors toward desired behaviors. Dr. Lovaas&rsquo; work is not without controversy. The use of physical aversives in his early treatment and the pathologization of a neurological difference, as stated by those in the neurodivergent movement, has led some to question the price of efficacy for applied behavior analytic therapies (Kirkham, 2017). Lovaas&rsquo; research and advocacy over decades, has made ABA, as an evidence based practice, the standard in treating autism. </p>
	</content>
	<content>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied Behavior Analysis continues to be a controversial therapeutic intervention. The controversy stems from the origins of the practice and its use of negative reinforcements, and in its earliest iterations, corporal punishment. Institutions, agencies, and individual providers will have different methods of implementation and teaching. Physical punishment is no longer seen as an acceptable method of behavior modification as ABA moves more towards a more trauma-informed approach. </p>
	</content>
	<content>
		<h2>Implementation methods and tools for Applied Behavior Analysis</h2>
		<p>The following sections are going to be jargon heavy and detailed, it covers who provides ABA, what composes ABA, and some of the different methods of implementation. I go into such detail in hopes to give some of the interviewee&rsquo;s responses a contextual background. </p>
		<h4>Service Providers</h4>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professionals that are involved in providing Applied Behavior Analysis services span many different areas of expertise and levels of education. Highlighted will be the basic structure of personnel that work to deliver treatment to individuals with developmental disabilities; behavior analysts and behavior technicians. Agencies and businesses cater to families with autistic children that have behavioral or sensory concerns. These agencies are often owned and operated by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA). The BCBA hires behavior technicians to give direct treatment implementation to clients in the community and at home. The BCBA creates a Comprehensive Treatment Model (CTM). CTM&rsquo;s can be customized to the client, but all treatment models will focus on adapting behaviors. &nbsp;That customization is composed of Focused Intervention Practices (FIP). These practices are the individual interventions that the client needs to work on, like using a visual schedule to remind a client of what is expected next. &nbsp;The behavior technician delivers the intervention directly to the client and reports back to the BCBA on the outcomes of the Focused Intervention Practices.</p>

		<h3>Applied Behavior Analysis structure</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main categories of interventions that are used within Applied Behavior Analysis. This paper focuses on early childhood interventions from birth to age 8. There are the Comprehensive Treatment Models (CTMs) and the Focused intervention practices. These two classes work together to create the structure for Applied Behavior Analysis implementation; FIP&rsquo;s are pieced together to create a custom CTM (Slocum et al., 2014). </p>
	</content>
	<content>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive Treatment Models (CTMs) are structured programs that are implemented for an extended period such as 25 to 30 hours a week over the course of a year. This intervention includes targeting multiple domains and includes multiple treatment components to address core features of autism. The typical domains that are targeted are cognitive function, social skills, and adaptive behaviors. Focused intervention practices are interventions designed to impact a single behavior or skill of an autistic person. CTMs include a variety of focused intervention practices. Examples of Focused intervention practices are Discrete trial teaching (DTT), Functional Communication Training (FCT), and video modeling. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discrete trial teaching (DTT), a focused intervention practice, is an ABA technique that dissects skills into smaller components and teaches them step by step. The first Key feature of DTT is the teaching sequence; a four step sequence that is cue, response, consequence, and pause. The cue step is the initial instruction or demand given by the teacher to start the trial. The response step is the child&rsquo;s response to the instruction or demand. The consequence step is the immediate response of the child&rsquo;s response which would result in either positive reinforcement or corrective feedback. Finally, the pause step is a brief break between the trials, also known as Intertrial Interval (ITI), that allows feedback and reset for the next trial as well as time allowed for data collection.</p>
  </content>
  <content>
		<p>The second key feature of DTT is reinforcement. Correct responses are followed by reinforcement such as praise, toys, or preferred activity. The third key feature of discrete trial teaching is repetition. Skills are taught through repeated practice. The fourth key feature of DTT is data collection. Pauses between trials are used to collect data on the learner&rsquo;s progress. The final key feature of discrete trial teaching is correction. If a response is incorrect, the teacher immediately corrects the learner. Corrective feedback could be a demonstration of the desired behavior after the child has been informed that they did not complete the expected behavior. </p>
		<p>Another example of Focused intervention practices is Functional Communication Training (FCT). A therapy that helps children with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disorders learn to communicate in a natural way. Some strategies used in FCT are: Identify the function of the behavior, what is causing it; teach an alternative response; use multiple forms of communication- pictures, gestures, written, and verbal language; and to allow for processing time. Functional communication training teaches an appropriate replacement behavior that could replace the interfering behavior. </p>
	</content>
	<content>
		<p>The last example of Focused intervention practices that will be presented is video modeling. This is a teaching technique that uses a video to demonstrate a skill or behavior, which the learner then copies. Benefits of video modeling are that it is non-intrusive, can be used with multiple students, can be produced in a natural setting, and can be used by support staff that have less training experience. The different types of video modeling are basic, where a peer or teacher demonstrates the desired behavior on video; self modeling, where the video is of the learner demonstrating a skill or behavior; and the last is point of view, where the video is taken from the perspective of the learner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different programs that can be implemented using Applied Behavior Analysis, but for the scope of this paper, only few will be highlighted. Examples of the Comprehensive Treatment Models (CMTs) are the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Young Autism Program, the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) program, the Denver/Early Start Denver Model (EDSM), and the Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention program (EIBI). </p>

	<content>
		<h3>Implementation Methods</h3>
		<p>The UCLA Young Autism Program is better known as the &ldquo;Lovaas model of ABA&rdquo;. This intensive program would consist of 40 hours per week of therapeutic intervention that is one on one for two to three years. The first year would be home sessions that were DTT formatted. The second year would include incidental teaching, and would introduce peer play with neurotypical children. In the third year, the therapy would decrease and there would be greater inclusion in the classroom setting. </p>
		<p>The TEACCH program is a structured teaching program based on common deficits and strengths of persons with autism. This is often referred to as &ldquo;the culture of autism&rdquo;. Structured teaching has four vital mechanisms: arranging of the environment, use of visual supports, using the individual&rsquo;s special interest, and encouraging appropriate communication. This program began with psychologist Dr. Eric Schopler in 1972. </p>
	</content>
	<content>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) is a program designed for preschool children ages 1 to 4. It focuses on enhancing pivotal skills such as cognition, communication, play, and social skills through playing, joint activities, and positive relationships. This program utilizes Pivotal Response Training (PVT) , an intervention that is play-based and goes along with the child&rsquo;s interests; an example would be a therapist using a child&rsquo;s favorite toy to encourage them to use communication to ask for it. EDSM can be implemented one to one or in a group setting. Caregiver involvement is a feature of this program and it is a relationship focused curriculum that is flexible. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention program is used with young children under the age of 5 and it is based on the Lovaas&rsquo; UCLA Young Autism Program. It is a 20 to 30 hour a week therapy based on the outcomes of functional skills assessments that lasts two or more years. It is initially a one to one format using DTT and incidental teaching. This program includes caregiver training and caregiver involvement as part of its practice. </p>

		<h2>Outcomes of Applied Behavior Analysis</h2>
		<p>&ldquo;Results may vary&rdquo;,an appropriate saying when it comes to speaking on the outcomes of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). Most families that begin therapeutic interventions are hoping for a way to better understand and mold the behavior that is occurring with their children. I will report on academic findings that may not reflect every individual experience. </p>
		<p>ABA is an overarching term and different institutions and agencies have developed different programs that all utilize ABA&rsquo;s basic principles, but do so in different ways. The UCLA Young Autism Program (YAP), the TEACCH Program, and the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) are the programs that I focus on regarding the outcomes of these particular interventions (Nicolosi et al., 2021; Sanz-Cervera et al., 2018; Rogers et al., 2012).</p>
	</content>
	<content>
		<p>All three of these programs report improvements in its participants in the areas of adaptive behaviors and communication. The YAP was the only program that specifically stated that intellectual improvements occurred, while the TEACCH program showed that parent and educator stress levels were also improved. The ESDM program highlighted improvements in social interaction and a reduction in social symptom presentation. These are wonderful results for the participants of these programs, but what needs to be stressed is that the time commitment from families was a major factor in success. Families are practicing therapeutic interventions for 12 months up to 3 years. In no way is Applied Behavior Analysis a quick fix.</p>
		<p>Successful program completion looks different from person to person, but is marked by an empirical change in behavior that has been documented. Winding down of programs means less therapeutic hours per week and or less meeting times per week until faded to zero. For agencies and providers, that can look like clients leading more empowered lives, caretakers feeling less stress, and greater community visibility. For autistic individuals this can mean greater inclusion in general education settings, more independence with skills for daily living, and increased efficient communication. </p>
  </content>
  <content>
		<p>Autistic clients may experience a variety of benefits from participating in ABA. Not everyone will experience these benefits, not all are positive. There are plenty of non-academic sources like blog posts and social media comments that will state that individuals had a negative experience with Applied Behavior Analysis. An example of an unintended skill acquired through participation in ABA is masking. Masking is a coping strategy to suppress autistic behaviors and appear more neurotypical. This skill is exacerbated when self-stimulating behaviors are targeted as a point of correction for ABA (Leaf et al., 2021). As much as it tries to be, ABA is not a one-size-fits-all. When a client and family don&rsquo;t align with the ABA program that has been received, trying a different program may be what is necessary. If Lovaas style ABA isn&rsquo;t working well, then maybe try the Floor Time model (ESDM). This decision, although should be made by clients and families, is often made by insurance companies. This is one major barrier in improving Applied Behavior Analysis. </p>
		<p>Insurance companies will generally only cover one type of ABA and if you wanted to try a different type of ABA, to better suit your family, you would need to pay out of pocket. This limits the variety of practices and practitioners that families can engage with, even if it would be better for their loved one. This can create inequalities in accessibility of care for the disabled community. </p>
		<p>So, what are the options when ABA is not effective?</p>
	</content>
	<content>
		<h2>Alternatives to Applied Behavior Analysis</h2>
		<p>When typically prescribed ABA is not yielding the desired results, families can look into alternatives. Nowadays there are many different options available. Talk therapy such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and support groups offer a way for autistic people and their caregivers to be able to adjust maladaptive behaviors and find camaraderie. Creative arts therapy employs the fine arts, such as painting and drawing, to be able to create an environment that promotes positive social interactions. Animal-assisted interventions allow individuals to be able to care for and care about different animals, such as horses, goats, dogs, and rabbits. On the medical side, pharmacological interventions like prescription medications have been shown to relieve patients of more severe autistic symptoms. While therapies such as Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) are more invasive, there have been reports of it reducing some of the most severe presentations, self-injury being one of them (Smith et al., 2024). </p>
		<p>While many alternative therapies exist the accessibility of these interventions is out of reach for many families. Insurance typically only covers conventional ABA services, not any of the alternative therapies mentioned above. This creates a grouping of families in the disability community that can afford to pay for therapies out of pocket, and those that cannot &ndash; an inequality that can and is being addressed at the legislative level in many states. There are individuals that state online that non-treatment is an effective intervention&ndash; a movement for the anti-pathologization of behaviors and instead works toward better accessibility and acceptance of and for neurodivergence. </p>

		<h2>Advocacy: What it is and how it can help.</h2>
		<p>Merriam-Webster dictionary defines advocacy as the act of supporting a cause or proposal. Autism advocacy relates to supporting autistic individuals, families, caretakers, and the greater autistic community. The type of advocacy can vary greatly. Advocates could help in areas from education plans, insurance issues, employment, policy making, and legal concerns. Some advocates will assist for free and others will charge a fee. In my experience as a very low income family,  it is not uncommon for many advocates that service my community to have waitlists.</p>

		<h4>The Good and the Bad: Autism research and resource Groups</h4>
		<p>What determines what is a good autism organization and a bad one? As listed on Stimpunks.org, a non-profit made by and for disabled people, there are several determinants. Signs of a good autism organization use identity-first language, i.e. autistic person instead of person with autism. It’s also stated the organization will use a neurodiversity paradigm and a social model language. A neurodiversity paradigm is a framework that views human brain differences as a natural part of human diversity (Silvertant). Social model language is “a way of speaking about disability that emphasizes the societal barriers and environmental factors that create disability, rather than focusing solely on the individual’s impairment” (Inclusion London). With these factors in mind a good autism organization will view a disabled person holistically, that their disability is just as much a part of themselves as any other, and that the organization doesn’t view disability as a personal deficit but rather societal barriers are preventing full participation in the world. Another sign of a good organization is that they have autistic people in leadership positions and reject cure language and eugenics. Signs of a bad autism organization would be trying to “cure” autism and imposing non-autistic-oriented goals (behaviorism) on individuals,no autistic people in leadership positions, along with endorsing ABA, and using puzzle piece imagery. </p>
